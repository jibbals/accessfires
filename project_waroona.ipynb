    "#### Do we expect PyroCB Based on modelled weather?\n",
    "Kevin Tory has developed code that takes a vertical profile of air and estimates how much fire power would be required for a PyroCB to develop.\n",
    "This power requirement is called the PyroCB Firepower Threshold (PFT), and by looking at the PFT over time in comparison to the modelled firepower, we can see whether a PyroCB is expected.\n",

    "These figures shows the PFT (dashed) and modelled firepower (solid) for three of the model runs:\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/waroona_old/fireplan/firepower_comparison.png\" alt=\"PFT and firepower\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "The __old run__ shows a couple of firepower spikes that exceed PFT, once __at 0430 and again at 0800 (UTC)__.\n",
    "Later plots also show PyroCB forming in this run.\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/waroona_run1/fireplan/firepower_comparison.png\" alt=\"PFT and firepower\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "__In run1__ the PFT never dips below the modelled firepower (but it comes close at 0800 UTC), and in fact no PyroCB are evident in looking through the output.\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/waroona_run2/fireplan/firepower_comparison.png\" alt=\"PFT and firepower\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "__Run 2__ shows firepower surpassing PFT frequently __between 0530 and 1400__.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modelled vertical wind speed and modelled cloud content\n",
    "To home in on where pyrocb may be forming, I zoom to a subset of the horizontal region that surrounds the fire. An idea of the nearby wind structures can be seen by taking horizontal model slices (at varying altitudes) of vertical wind motion (filled contour map), and total cloud content (black outlines).\n",

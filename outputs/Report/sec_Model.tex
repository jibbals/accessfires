\section{Model} 
  \label{model}

  \subsection{ACCESS}  
    \textbf{TODO: Blurb about ACCESS}
    
    \paragraph{Model output} are 4-dimensional: latitude, longitude, vertical level ($\theta$ or $\rho$), and time. Most fields are defined at their grid-box midpoints. Wind speed and direction is defined at the direction-dependent gridbox edge.
    
    
  \subsection{Coupled Fire Model}
    \textbf{TODO: Details about fire model}
    
    \paragraph{Model output} has the same latitude and longitude as ACCESS output, with more frequent time steps and no vertical component.
    A fire front field is produced that is negative where the fire has burnt, and positive elsewhere.
    
  
  
  
  \subsection{Model runs}
    \label{model:runs}
    Over the course of the project the ACCESS-Fire model has been run and updated multiple times, over two regions where large scale forest fires occurred.
    The model runs in a nested fashion, with three to four nests so that the highest resolution possible is produced in a reasonable manner at the site of the fires (e.g. Figure \ref{fig:model:nests}).
    
    The first fire under examination occurred a few kilometers East from Waroona, a suburb South of Perth.
    The second occurred a few hundred kilometres North of Sydney. 
    Both locations are modelled at high resolution using ACCESS-Fire in a nested setup (Figure \ref{fig:model:nests}).

      \caption{Three nests run by ACCESS-Fire model are shown as black\/red rectangles. 
      The outermost nest has resolution of approximately 3.5 km by 3.5 km, 
      The intermediary Nest is at 1.0 km by 1.0 km, and the smallest nest (red) is at 0.3 km by 0.3 km.
      A fourth nest is sometimes added 
      %taking up the same space as Nest 3 but 
      with .1 km by .1 km resolution.
      Fire coupling is enabled only within the higher resolution (red) nests.}

    This report analyses output from the latest iteration of ACCESS-Fire, earlier iterations are listed here as they may help elucidate model parameterisation decisions.

  \subsection{Modelled Weather}
    \label{model:weather_summary}
    
    Weather is examined at various scales by sub-selecting extents and vertical levels, then viewing horizontal and vertical winds, cloud content, and other available metrics. This section outlines in chronological order the overall weather in the latest model run for each site.
    
    
    Figure \ref{fig:model:weather_summary_eg} shows a synoptic overview at one point in time over the Waroona fire, with clear updraught and cloud activity just down-wind of the firefront.
    
    \begin{figure}
      \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../../figures/waroona_run3/weather_summary/fig_201601061010.png}
      \caption{Left panels show horizontal wind speed (coloured contour map) and wind direction (arrows).
      Right panels show vertical wind speed (coloured contour map) and cloud content (diagonal stippling).
      The wind speeds are averaged into vertical bins based on height above the ground, showing lower to higher altitudes from the first row to the last row respectively.
      Cloud content is summed within each vertical bin, and the areas marked have at least 0.1 gkg$^{-1}$ of water and ice.}

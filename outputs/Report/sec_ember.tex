      Top panel: Top down view of topography, surface horizontal winds (quivers), and 300m above ground vertical wind contour. Vertical winds are shown with dashed lines (at 3 m/s) upwards and downwards (pink, blue respectively). 
      Waroona is marked by a grey dot.
      Middle panel: Potential temperature transect along dashed black line in panel 1. An arrow points to the X-axis depicting the west-most point of the fire front, and an arrow along the Y-axis showing the altitude of the vertical wind contours shown in the top panel.
      Bottom panel: Vertical motion transect (coloured) with quivers showing wind speed and direction on the east-west-vertical plane.}

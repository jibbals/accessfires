  \paragraph{Formation}
    General hand wavey physics etc.
     
  \paragraph{Model formation}
    Details regarding how PCB is found/examined in model output.
    Story about how the parameters affect model PCB formation.
  
    Some stuff about vorticity and other metrics?
    
  \paragraph{PCB Formation Threshold}
    Kevin's PFT - point to his publication.
    Calculation within model output
    Summary showing that when fire spreads fast the output is higher.
    High output coinciding with low PFT is exactly when PCB occurs.
